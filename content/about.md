title: About Casey
---
Casey is a 2022 grad from the College of William & Mary, with a degree in Film/Media Studies. He completed his graduate program in Film Scoring Technology at Berklee College of Music Online. His areas of interest are film/media scoring and music composition/performing. He is also a multi-instrumentalist/musician, playing guitar, piano, bass, cello, violin, drums, mandolin, melodica, gemshorn, hurdy-gurdy, and additional percussion.

While at William and Mary, Casey took multiple courses/independent studies in film scoring, music composition, tonal theory, and computer music. He has worked on many student and alumni films/projects.

Right before the pandemic shut down the campus, Casey won the William and Mary Student Composition Competition (2020) for his Road Runner rescore. It was performed live by the William and Mary Orchestra. While at William & Mary, Casey performed with one of the campus music ensembles. In addition, Casey has written, recorded, and performed original music (and continues to do so) both solo and as part of the duo Spare Jingles.

Casey's graduate courses at Berklee included multiple classes in Orchestration, Film Scoring Technology, and Music Composition, as well as Video Game Scoring. As he continues to grow his knowledge base/skills through his graduate courses, Casey is interested in building his portfolio and continuing to score/compose projects and collaborate with other composers/filmmakers. Casey’s latest projects include the short film Maggie Campbell, premiering in 2024, Call Earl, which premiered at the Overlook Film Festival in 2025, and Untouchable, also premiering in 2025.

Casey has enjoyed scoring across genres, from comedy to horror to cartoons to experimental documentaries, and would like to continue broadening his scope of what genres he can compose for. Casey has many film scoring/composition influences, ranging from orchestral to electronic - and especially those who bring a grounding in musicianship and performance to their compositions/scores – a creative path he strives to emulate.
